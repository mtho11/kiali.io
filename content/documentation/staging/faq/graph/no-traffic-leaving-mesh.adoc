See link:#missing-edges[Why do I have missing edges?], and additionally consider:

3- Requests are not configured for telemetry.

You need to create a ServiceEntry (or several) to allow the requests to be mapped correctly.

There are a couple of bugs related to this, https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/15188[one] incorrectly maps traffic
to other ServiceEntry while the https://github.com/istio/istio/issues/15038[other] is about not seeing a ServiceEntry
even if is configured correctly.

traffic in Kiali] for more information.
