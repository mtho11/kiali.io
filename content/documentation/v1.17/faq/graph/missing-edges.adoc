Kiali just shows the telemetry in Prometheus and if you don't see what you expect it probably means that it has not been reported in
Prometheus.  Which means ususally that 1) the requests are not actually sent, 2) sidecars are missing,
3) requests are leaving the mesh and are not configured for telemetry

Kiali builds the graph from Istio's telemetry.
If you don't see what you expect it probably means that it has not been reported in Prometheus.
This usually means that:

1- The requests are not actually sent.

2- Sidecars are missing.

For example, If you don't see traffic going from node A to node B, but you are sure there is traffic, the first thing
you should be doing is checking the telemetry by
https://istio.io/docs/tasks/telemetry/metrics/querying-metrics/[querying the metrics], for example, if you know that
MyWorkload-v1 is sending requests to ServiceA  try looking for metrics of the type:

`istio_requests_total{destination_service="ServiceA"}`

If telemetry is missing then it may be better to take it up with https://github.com/istio/istio/issues[Istio]
